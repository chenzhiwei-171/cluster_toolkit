# Cluster Toolkit
This repository contains routines used in the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 stacked cluster weak lensing analysis. These routines form the basis of the model of cluster lensing profiles.

If you have any questions feel free to get in contact or consult [the documentation](http://cluster-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

*Important*: the toolkit is very much as "living code" at the moment. That is, for now I am still pushing to master very regularly. Until this is uploaded to PyPI and available via pip, pull and reinstall often to stay up to date.
