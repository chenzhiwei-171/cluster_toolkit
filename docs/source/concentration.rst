Mass-concentration Relations
******************************

The inner regions of clusters are called the 1-halo regime. The 1-halo regime is often modeled analytically using either an NFW or Einasto profile. Both of these profiles are functions of at least two variables. Numerous papers have examined the relationship between mass and NFW halo concentration. This module will soon have implemented the Diemer-Kravtzov 2015 M-c relation.
