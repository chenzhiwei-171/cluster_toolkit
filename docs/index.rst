Cluster Toolkit Documentation!
======================================

Cluster Toolkit is a Python package specifically built for calculating weak lensing signals from galaxy clusters and cluster cosmology.
The core functionality of the package includes:

 * 3D correlation functions :math:`\xi(r)`
 * 3D density functions :math:`\rho(r)`
 * Projected density and differential profiles :math:`\Sigma(R)` and :math:`\Delta\Sigma`
 * Boost factor models :math:`\mathcal{B} = (1-f_{\rm cl})^{-1}`
 * Miscentering affects on projected profiles :math:`f_{\rm mis}`

The source code is publically available at https://github.com/tmcclintock/cluster_toolkit.
