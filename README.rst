Cluster Toolkit
===============

This repository contains routines used in the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 stacked cluster weak lensing analysis. These routines form the basis of the model of cluster lensing profiles.

If you have any questions feel free to get in contact or consult `the documentation <http://cluster-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Note: the toolkit should be considered in beta. The API is subject to change and some failure modes may exist for extreme models.
